            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
          </p>

          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
            different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and
            play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur
            exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone
            home).
