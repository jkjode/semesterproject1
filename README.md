## Acknowledgments

This was the last project we did before entering the world of JavaScript.
This is built purely with CSS and HTML and as such the Hamburger-menu is made with a "checkbox-hack".

At this point of time I was a bit overwhelmed with the CSS part and completely lost track of my semantics. There is double, triple and quadruple the amount of CSS to what I would do now, and even more than is needed.
For this project, it was "too big" for my level of CSS to keep it clean, but I managed fairly well.
